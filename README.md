# Codes-for-Benchmarking
 Codes used for video transcoding on heterogenous platforms
 1) Split 100 videos into .ts files
 2) Standardize all .ts files into a standard format.
 3) Run experiments of video transconding on heterogenous platforms (Virtual Machine, Baremetal Server, Container on Virtual Machine, Container on Baremetal Server).
 4) Get execution time of video transcoding for (Bitrate, Framerate, Codec anf Resolution)
 
 etc
 1) Get all sizes of GOP
 2) Get original videos' duration resolution etc
 3) Get averages of how long it takes to transcode a video (multiple GOPS)
 4) Get average of how long it takes to transcode 100 videos
